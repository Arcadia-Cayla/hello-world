# hello-world

This is just a test. Nothing super interesting here, just a means to an end. A way to access other peoples' code and use it. A way to pretend I'm a bioinformatician or computer scientist or whatever when really I'm just using a tool others have created to get a job completed. I am a researcher who will use whatever tool is necessary to get the project completed... within a reasonable assumption of "whatever" as defined by me who is influenced by Society.

Interesting. That seems to all be on the one line.
